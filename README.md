# Computer Science for JavaScript: Regex Tutorial

A tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does.

## Description
In this published GitHub gist I am explaining the regex for matching emails using Regex.What is a Regex? It is a short name of Regular Expression. Essentially it is a search pattern used to find, replace or validate user input. This tutorial will go through each part of the expression and will describe what it does to use in matching an email address.For the record I did not come up with this regex pattern myself. I will be using this regex pattern as a teaching example. By breakdown this regex down character for character I will be able to show you the different parts and pieces of a regex.
